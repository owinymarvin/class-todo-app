# Todo App 

# Abstract
This project is to help users to create and manage their tasks effectively. A user will create a task, receive a notification or reminder when its due. 

# Functional Specifications. 
To meet the users privacy needs
1. Users can create new accounts, login and update their information(username, email and password.)  
2. Tasks can be created, updated and deleted by the User. Tasks that are overdue will be deleted after 7 days. 
3. Email notifications are sent when user registers, logs in and when a task is 30 min to due time. 
4. A superUser can delete Users. 

# Technological specifications
1. The User will need an internet connection to access the website
2. A "requirements.txt" file shows all the app dependencies. they include django 4.1, pillow, django-crontab, etc. 

# Folder structure explanation and challenges
Meaningful names have been used to help a reader unserstand what each function does as well as what each template is for.
The django project "todo_project" has two apps, "accounts, and todo_app". 
The accounts app is used for all user requests e.g. registration,login,logout,editing profile, editing password, reseting password
The todo_app is used for creating, updating, deleting tasks. The calendar logic was applied here as well.
